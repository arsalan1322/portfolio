        I'm a senior undergraduate student from University of Toronto,
        majoring in Physics and minoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.
        I'm broadly interested in integrated quantum photonics research. I'm not simply interested in research only for
        the sake of science - that is just a bonus - but want to take advantage of my creativity to innovate and solve
        problems that will have a direct impact on on the industry. I want my contributions to lead to startups and to
        pave the way for novel research niches in these areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have enough experience in academia and industry to understand how much I have yet to learn, as well as the
        approches I would need to take to become a leading figure in the field. An obvious next step to achieve
        these goals now is for me to obtain a PhD which will allow me to master the available tools and techniques to
        the point where I can comfortably generate novel ideas.

        I have a multidisciplanary background from various research positions, industry internships, extracuricculars,
        as well as personal projects. This background includes, but is not limited to, nonlinear quantum photonics,
        multiplexing and optical cross connects, automation of lab experiments, quantum information and alogrithms, deep
        learning (mainly TensorFlow), developing a software architecture for an early stage startup, software
        development, and robotics.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time I enjoy exploring my creativity in other avenues such as drawing, and have recently picked up
        sewing and designing my own clothes. I'm also extremely enthusiastic about music and enjoy exploring new
        experimental genres. I'm now trying to learn how to produce my own music.

          <h3>Machine Unlearning</h3>
          <p>Machine learning project, December 2023</p>
          <p>
            This project explores a novel method for "unlearning" previously
            learned datapoints from a model. Unlearning is the process of
            having a deployed machine learning model forget about some of its
            training data points. This can be achieved through exact
            unlearning methods such as Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and
            Aggregated (SISA), which involve formally removing the data
            point’s impact on the model by retraining the model from scratch;
            or approximate unlearning, where the model parameters are
            approximated to save on computational costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            We implement and test the SISA approach on multiple datasets
            (CIFAR-10 and MNIST) and multiple neural network architectures.
            Our work seeks to extend SISA by exploring combinations of SISA
            with ensemble methods, and to empirically test the effects of
            hyperparameters on relatively simple computer vision
            classification tasks.
