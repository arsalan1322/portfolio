        <p>
          I'm a senior undergraduate student from University of Toronto,
          majoring in Physics and minoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.
          I'm currently interested in research regarding the hardware side of
          quantum computing, particularly integrated quantum photonics, but am
          also experienced in the software and machine learning side of quantum
          computing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a multidisciplanary background from various research positions,
          industry internships, extracuricculars, as well as personal projects.
          This background includes, but is not limited to, deep learning (mainly
          TensorFlow), software development, photonics, quantum optics, and
          robotics. I'm still exploring different fields and am happy to take on
          challenging opportunities at the intersection of these topics.

        <p>Recent Work:</p>
        <p>
          In the past, I've been involved in multiple photonics and quantum
          optics research projects in
          <a href="http://rocket.light.utoronto.ca/helmy/"
            >Professor Amr Helmy's group</a
          >. I've presented some of my results at the
          <a href="https://cupc.cap.ca/">CUPC</a> and have also completed my
          undergraduate thesis in the group.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently involved in a
          <a href="https://utmist.gitlab.io/projects/qusparse/"
            >quantum machine learning research project</a
          >
          in collaboration with University of Toronto Machine Intelligence
          Student Team (<a href="https://utmist.gitlab.io/">UTMIST</a>),
          exploring various quantum machine learning algorithms with
          applications in sparse signal reconstruction. We expect to publish our
          results as well as present at multiple conferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also involved in an applied machine learning research project
          under the supervision of
          <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k9L6jPYAAAAJ&hl=en"
            >Professor Pekka Sinervo</a

          <a href="https://www.snolab.ca/experiment/supercdms/"
            >SNOLAB SuperCDMS collaboration</a
          >, which seeks to unravel the secrets of dark matter. More
          specifically, I'm responsible for developing and training deep neural
          networks to improve the accuracy of the dark matter detector
          measurements.

          Finally, I'll be interning at

            <h3>Machine Unlearning</h3>
            <p>Machine learning project, December 2023</p>
            <p>
              This project explores a novel method for "unlearning" previously
              learned datapoints from a model. Unlearning is the process of
              having a deployed machine learning model forget about some of its
              training data points. This can be achieved through exact
              unlearning methods such as Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and
              Aggregated (SISA), which involve formally removing the data
              point’s impact on the model by retraining the model from scratch;
              or approximate unlearning, where the model parameters are
              approximated to save on computational costs.
            </p>
            <p>
              We implement and test the SISA approach on multiple datasets
              (CIFAR-10 and MNIST) and multiple neural network architectures.
              Our work seeks to extend SISA by exploring combinations of SISA
              with ensemble methods, and to empirically test the effects of
              hyperparameters on relatively simple computer vision
              classification tasks.
